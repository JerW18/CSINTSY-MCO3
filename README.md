# CSINTSY-MCO3
**CSINTSY Major Course Output 3: Comparative Analysis of Different Machine Learning Model from scikit-learn**

The project aims to explore and compare various machine learning algorithms available in scikit-learn library to build an accurate and efficient model for identifying diabetes. The project leveraged a publicly available diabetes dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset) to train and evaluate multiple models, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and performance metrics.
